# Introduction to Rust Programming Language

<br>

## The most asked question, why Rust?
What qualities define an exceptional programming language?

1. **Elegance:** Solves big problems with an elegant solution without compromise (like zero-cost abstractions).
3. **Efficiency:** Beyond just speed, it's about resource conservation.
2. **Safety:** Handle errors gracefully even before the program runs.
4. **Battle tested usage:** More than a pet project, it's applicable in real-world scenarios
    - **Examples**: [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Linux (kernel)](https://docs.kernel.org/rust/index.html), [System76](https://system76.com/), [Microsoft (kernel, Windows API, Azure)](https://www.microsoft.com/), [Google (Android)](https://www.android.com/), [Amazon (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), [CloudFlare (Pingora)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pingora-open-source), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/), [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/). The list of successful cases are endless!

# What Rust Offers
2. **Comes with a Warranty:** Confidence in code integrity.
4. **Practicality:** Solutions that work where they're needed.
3. **Elegance in Code:** Crafting solutions with beauty and precision without compromising performance.
1. **Close to the Metal:** Bridging the gap between high-level languages and C/C++.

# Comes with a Warranty
- Lifetimes tracked by the type system eliminate null pointer exceptions.
- Explicit error handling promotes predictability.
- Robust type system mitigates common errors.
- Programs safeguard against system corruption by default (unless overridden by explicit use of `unsafe`).

# Close to the Metal (Low-level Performance Comparable to C/C++)
- Leveraging LLVM for cutting-edge code generation.
- Suitable for embedded systems, OS development, and high-demand web applications.
- No intrusive garbage collectors hindering execution.
- Compilation over interpretation for optimized performance.

# Practicality
- Endorsement from industry giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and more.
- Widely supported across multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, ARM).
- A thriving community ensures a vibrant ecosystem (the language itself was built by the community, not by a corporation).
- Seamlessly integrates with legacy C code.

# Elegance in Code
- Toolchain offers suggestions for refining code quality.
- An expressive language embracing both declarative and imperative paradigms.
- Versatile data types that aptly represent various problem domains.
- Concise syntax reduces boilerplate and enhances readability.
