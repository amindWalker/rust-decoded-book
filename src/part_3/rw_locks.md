# Implementing Read/Write Locks

In multi-threaded Rust programming, **`RwLock`** (Read-Write Lock) is pivotal for managing shared data efficiently. It facilitates concurrent reads while ensuring exclusive access for writes, offering versatility for varied read and write demands.

## Choosing Between `Mutex<T>` and `RwLock<T>`

When selecting between **`Mutex<T>`** and **`RwLock<T>`**, consider this characteristics:

- **`Mutex<T>`**: Suited for scenarios needing exclusive access for both reads and writes or when simplicity outweighs marginal performance gains.
- **`RwLock<T>`**: Excels in read-heavy workloads, enabling concurrent reads while ensuring safe writes.

It's crucial to benchmark and profile specific to your use case for an informed choice, as performance characteristics may vary across platforms.

## Basic Usage Example:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock};
use std::{thread, time::Duration};
use std::collections::HashMap;

struct Bank {
    accounts: RwLock<HashMap<String, f64>>,
}

impl Bank {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Bank {
            accounts: RwLock::new(HashMap::new()),
        }
    }

    fn deposit(&self, account: &str, amount: f64) {
        let mut accounts = self.accounts.write().unwrap();
        let balance = accounts.entry(account.to_string()).or_insert(0.0);
        *balance += amount;
    }

    fn withdraw(&self, account: &str, amount: f64) {
        let mut accounts = self.accounts.write().unwrap();
        let balance = accounts.entry(account.to_string()).or_insert(0.0);
        if *balance >= amount {
            *balance -= amount;
        } else {
            println!("Insufficient funds for account: {}", account);
        }
    }

    fn check_balance(&self, account: &str) -> f64 {
        let accounts = self.accounts.read().unwrap();
        *accounts.get(account).unwrap_or(&0.0)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let bank = Arc::new(Bank::new());
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for i in 0..5 {
        let bank_clone = Arc::clone(&bank);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let account = format!("Account{}", i);
            bank_clone.deposit(&account, 100.0);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)); // Simulate other work
            bank_clone.withdraw(&account, 30.0);
            let balance = bank_clone.check_balance(&account);
            println!("{} - Balance: {:.2}", account, balance);
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```

## `RwLock` Advantage:

- **Improved Parallelism**: Replacing **`Mutex`** with **`RwLock`** enhances parallelism in read-heavy scenarios, allowing multiple threads to read concurrently while maintaining exclusive write access.
- **Clear Synchronization**: Methods like **`write()`** and **`read()`** provide clear synchronization, enabling controlled access to shared data. Writes are exclusive, while reads can occur concurrently.
- **Optimized Performance**: This change optimizes the program for scenarios where reads outnumber writes, enhancing concurrency and resource utilization without altering the core logic.
- **Consistent Output**: Despite synchronization changes, the output remains consistent, displaying account balances after simulated transactions.

By leveraging **`RwLock`**, the code achieves a balance between read and write access, enhancing efficiency in scenarios dominated by reads, thereby improving concurrency and resource usage compared to **`Mutex`** in read-heavy workloads.

# RwLock In-Depth

While **`Mutex`** provides exclusive data access, **`RwLock`** enables multiple threads to read data concurrently, making it advantageous for frequently read but infrequently modified data.

## Managing Shared Data with RwLock

**`RwLock`** is a synchronization primitive in Rust allowing multiple threads to read data concurrently while ensuring exclusive access for writing. This is particularly useful for data scenarios with frequent reads but infrequent modifications.

## Implementation Example:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::{RwLock, Arc};

fn main() {
    let data = Arc::new(RwLock::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..5 {
        let data = Arc::clone(&data);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let data_guard = data.read().unwrap();
            println!("Read: {}", *data_guard);
            drop(data_guard); // Drop read lock to allow other threads to read concurrently
            thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100)); // Simulate work
            let mut data_write = data.write().unwrap();
            *data_write += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {:?}", *data.read().unwrap());
}
```

### Output:

```
Read: 0
Read: 0
Read: 0
Read: 0
Read: 0
Result: 5
```

This example demonstrates **`RwLock`** facilitating dynamic control over the number of reader threads, essential for applications with varying concurrency needs.

# Advanced Usages of RwLock in Rust

**`RwLock`** in Rust extends beyond basic read and write operations, offering a versatile toolset for efficient concurrent data access.

## Dynamic Number of Readers

One notable feature of **`RwLock`** is its ability to dynamically manage the number of reader threads, as showcased below:

```rust
use std::sync::{RwLock, Arc};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let data = Arc::new(RwLock::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for i in 0..10 {
        let data = Arc::clone(&data);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let data_guard = data.read().unwrap();
            println!("Reader {}: {}", i, *data_guard);
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Reader 0: 0
Reader 1: 0
Reader 2: 0
Reader 3: 0
Reader 4: 0
Reader 5: 0
Reader 6: 0
Reader 7: 0
Reader 8: 0
Reader 9: 0
```

This dynamic capability empowers **`RwLock`** to adapt to varying workloads and concurrency requirements effectively.
